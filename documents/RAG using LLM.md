Retrieval Augmented Generation using Large Language Models


Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI technique that retrieves information from an external knowledge base to ground large language models (LLMs) on accurate, up-to-date information. Here are some reasons you might want to use RAG:

* Access to up-to-date information. The knowledge of LLMs is limited to what they were exposed to during pre-training. With RAG, you can ground the LLM to the latest data feeds, making it perfect for real-time use cases.

* Incorporating proprietary data. LLMs weren't exposed to your proprietary enterprise data (data about your users or your specific domain) during their training and have no knowledge of your company data. With RAG, you can expose the LLM to company data that matters.

* Minimizing hallucinations. LLMs are not accurate knowledge sources and often respond with made-up answers. With RAG, you can minimize hallucinations by grounding the model to your data.

* Rapid comparison of LLMs. RAG applications allow you to rapidly compare different LLMs for your target use case and on your data, without the need to first train them on data (avoiding the upfront cost and complexity of pre-training or fine-tuning).

* Control over the knowledge the LLM is exposed to. RAG applications let you add or remove data without changing the model. Company policies change, customers' data changes, and unlearning a piece of data from pre-trained model is expensive. With RAG, it's much easier to remove data points from the knowledge your LLM is exposed to.
